# Run the Project üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è

0. if you pull project for the first time. read 'Project Setup'
1. if you just fetch git history.
   - (if new library is added) : `pnpm install` to install new lib.
   - (if database is changes) : `npx prisma migrate dev` to migrate database
   - (if new data is seeded) : run `node prisma/{seed file}` for example `node prisma/seed.js`
2. if you already setting up project. Just use
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   PS : if port being in use. `docker ps -a` to see what container id using that port. Then use `docker stop {container_id}` to stop it.

# Project Setup

- copy `.env.example` then change name to `.env`
- run these command

```
pnpm install
docker-compose up -d
pnpm add @prisma/client prisma
pnpm prisma generate
node prisma/seed/init_seed.js
```

- when you change prisma schmema and want to migrate it

```
npx prisma migrate dev
node prisma/seed/{your_seed}.js
```

### Techs / Frameworks / Libs

- Frontend -> Next.js (TailwindCSS with ShadCN)
- Backend -> Next.js
- Database -> PostgreSQL
- ORM (object-relational mapping) -> Prisma

### (Danger Zone!!!) To delete data base and start from scratch

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
docker volume ls
docker volume rm 2tinkerbread_postgres-data
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

// you have to run prisma migration again
npx prisma migrate dev
pnpm run seed
```

# Convention about git

- Branch name : <dev name>/<type>/<task name>
  - ex. tonnam/feat/scan-qrcode
- Commit message : <type>(<project name>): <description>
